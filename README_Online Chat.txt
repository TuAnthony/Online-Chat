GETTING STARTED:

To use this application, either visit https://TuAnthony.github.io/chatter.html or open chatter.html in a browser of your choice (an updated version of Chrome or Firefox is recommended!)
As it is a small program contained in a single html file, self-hosting is easily doable if desired.

CONNECTING TO PEERS:
To connect to a friend, first open the Chatter application  (local or hosted online, either will work)
Next, either manually copy your ID (a string resembling kztkcik5cdr00000), or left click on the "Click here to copy invite link!" text to automatically copy an invite link to your clipboard. Then, share this with them.
Note: Invite links are built using the current URL you are accessing Chatter from, so if you are viewing a local file copy then the unmodified link will not work for them unless they have chatter.html saved in an identical location.
Finally, instruct your friend to either open Chatter and copy/paste your ID into the "Connect to" box, or tell them to simply click on the invite link. You should then be connected.
Any amount of friends can join each other in this manner, just share an invite link or ID of any current member with them.

CHATTING:
To chat, it's recommended to first add a username in the Username field. This can be changed at any time and isn't required. Next, type a message and hit enter or click the Send button.
The Clear Messages button will clear your local copy of messages.
To share an image, click the file upload button and select a valid image file. Formats such as PNG, JPG, and GIF are supported.
